# Dotfiles
My dotfiles for tools such as ***zsh, tmux, nvim*** etc. These dotfiles are accompanied by their respective custom-built installers.

## Installation
There are 2 different methods you can use. You can manually install the dotfiles by cloning the repository and placing the contents in their respective destinations, or you can make use of the installers. **Using the installers is recommended** because it will install any dependencies, fonts and place everything where necessary.

### Custom installers
Before moving ahead, do note that the installer has been tested on the following systems:
